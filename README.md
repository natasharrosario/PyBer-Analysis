# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to perform an exploratory analysis on data from a hypothetical, Python-based ridesharing app company, PyBer. Using Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, I created DataFrames and a multi-line graph to display the total weekly fares for each city type.  

## Results

#### Summary DataFrame

The DataFrame below shows the number of total rides, drivers, and fares for drivers in Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities, as well as the average fare per ride and the average amount each driver makes per ride. According to this data, urban cities have the highest number of total drivers and offer the highest number of total rides, while rural cities have the least drivers and offer the least rides. Throughout the year during which this data was collected, fares for PyBers in urban cities were about 10 times higher than those in rural cities. The average fare per ride in urban cities is about $10 less than in rural cities, and, on average, drivers in rural cities collect about 3.5 times more per ride than drivers in urban cities.

#### Total Fares by City Type

The graph below shows the total fares by city type between January and April of 2019. While the general trend between city types throughout these four months is roughly the same, it is clear that fares for PyBers in urban cities is much higher than those in rural cities, with fares for suburban cities falling somewhere in between.

## Summary

The demand for PyBers in urban cities is much higher than in any other city type, and PyBer collects the highest amount of fares for rides in urban cities. The average fare per ride is the lowest in urban cities, because of the large number of drivers and rides, so in turn, drivers make the least amount of money per ride. 

The demand for PyBers in rural cities is much lower than in any other city type, and PyBer collects the lowest amount of fares for rides here. The average fare per ride is the highest, because of the low number of drivers and rides, so drivers make the most amount of money per ride.

### Recommendations

This analysis and the above visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

To address any disparities among city types, I would recommend 1) putting less drivers in urban cities. It is the only city type with more drivers than rides, so less drivers would increase the average fare per ride and allow drivers to collect more for each ride. These drivers could be 2) moved to suburban communities, where there is still a fairly high demand for PyBers. This way, drivers from urban cities would still be able to work, and the average fare per ride would be lower for riders without causing much change in total fares. Lastly, the data shows that total fares for all city types goes up in the month of March, which I would assume is the result of increased tourism during Spring Break; more PyBers are being ordered and thus total fares are much higher. In this case, I would recommend 3) temporarily contracting more drivers during this time to accommodate higher demand and lower the average cost per ride for riders. Drivers will most likely be giving much more rides during this time, which will balance out the lower amount they will collect per ride.
